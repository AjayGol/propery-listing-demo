# Property Listing App

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Start the JSON Server (Required)

The app requires a local JSON server to provide API data. Start the server first:

```bash
npm run server
```

This will start the JSON server on `http://localhost:3001` with the property and booking data.

**Important**: Keep this terminal window open while using the app. The server must be running for the app to function properly.

### Step 2: Start the Expo Development Server

In a new terminal window, start the Expo development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Expo development server and open the Expo developer tools in your browser.
